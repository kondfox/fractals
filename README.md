# Project Exercises

Draw fractals with recursive functions.

### Experience points
- Each fractal has a certain amount of experience points (XP) that can be earned by completing it
- To level up and journey safely to the next week's challenges make sure you earn at least 2 XP
- *Tip: Go with 4 XP if you're on __insane__ difficulty setting.*

### Bonus XPs
- make it multi-color for 1 XP
- make the sizes slightly change randomly for 1 XP
- make it animate for 4 XPs
